# Submissions 

*Westmarch* invites submissions for its first Spring 2024 issue entitled “Winter’s Tales”. This issue will cover any and all topics related to Medieval and Renaissance literature. *Westmarch* prides itself on including a wide variety of content and accepts literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and narrative nonfiction. As such, any and all stories set from approximately 500-1650 AD are quite welcome (or any fantasy stories with comparable worldbuilding). We accept poetry engaging with Medieval and Renaissance forms, themes, or other related topics. Literary criticism engaging with Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, or any of the many other writers of this period is also encouraged.
 
We welcome submissions from all current undergraduates, as well as students who have graduated, but submit a paper written during their undergraduate career. All submissions must be under 5,500 words. All submissions must also be in MLA format. Submissions are due February 9th. Please send all submissions to [westmarch@westmarchjournal.org](mailto:westmarch@westmarchjournal.org).
