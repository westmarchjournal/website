Dear Reader,

Autumn seems a bit more vibrant in Virginia this year. Fiery orange trees stand in stark contrast against a mellow sky of clouds. The other day, I looked out my window to see a whirlwind of burning red leaves carried by a sudden breeze. The wind, with all its beauty and symbolism, serves as the theme for this semester's first volume of *Westmarch*. 

In his "Ode to the West Wind," the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley addresses the autumn wind as a spirit moving across the earth, carrying strange and new beauties everywhere it goes. He invokes the wind as his poetic muse, imploring it to "[m]ake me thy lyre," to bring the words of his poetry to life and carry them throughout the world. Wind, for the Romantic poets, serves as a symbol of inspiration; the poetry is the instrument by which the beauty in nature is revealed. 

This volume is largely filled with works inspired by the wonder of the world around us. It aims to celebrate the ability of the poet to illumine the truth and beauty found in nature. Yet it also seeks to recognize the Holy Spirit, who descended upon his disciples like a rushing wind, as the truth source of inspiration, and to inspire awe at creation because it reflects its Creator. May we all, like the poets, have imaginations able to perceive the majesty of God in the created order. 

Sincerely,\
Lauren Crane\
